## Make a directory and source code file for this project in **Terminal**
1. `% mkdir ~/projects/learnCPP/2_multiplyBy2`
2. `% touch ~/projects/learnCPP/2_multiplyBy2/2_multiplyBy2.cpp`

## Begin coding in **VS Code**
1. Open **VS Code** in learnCPP working directory, if not already open
    1. `% code ~/projects/learnCPP/`
2. Double-click **2_multiplyBy2.cpp** in **VS Code**'s *Explorer* tab to open the file

## Add boilerplate
```c++
/* 
    projects/learnCPP/2_multiplyBy2.cpp

    Expected behavior:
    1. Get integer from console user input
    2. Print integer multiplied by 2 to console

## Write code

## Build **2_multiplyBy2** executable
1. In **VS Code** on **2_multiplyBy2.cpp**, click the *Play* button to build the project
2. If there are build errors or warnings, then debug necessary until it builds cleanly

## Run **2_multiplyBy2** executable
1. Open a new **Terminal** in **VS Code** if needed, keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+Shift+` ``
2. Run executable
    1. `% ./2_multiplyBy2/2_multiplyBy2`
3. If executable is not performing as expected, debug as necessary until it does

## Post project review
1. The use of more symbols and type declarations than **Python** will probably result in quite a few build errors in the beginning
