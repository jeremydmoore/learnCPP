## Projects to learn C++

*Jeremy D. Moore, Moore Creative Arts, LLC*

I created this repository to store the projects I've created while learning C++.

This project started with a macOS computer and no development environment.

### If you wish to follow my path, I suggest starting with [**0_setup.md**](https://github.com/jeremydmoore/learnCPP/blob/main/0_setup.md) and typing out the projects yourself instead of copying this repository.
